## Preferred Method of Communication & Response Time

It is each student's responsibility to join the class Discord  
group "ase24". Till Friday week1, the link to join there 
is [here](https://discord.gg/sHqMa9jK). After that time , please contact the lecturer.

Most of the class communication from staff to students will be via this Discord group.

You should expect to receive a response within two business days (i.e. not over the weekend). 
- If I email/message you directly, please strive to respond within two business days. 
- It is recommended that you check your NC State email at least once a day to stay on top of course communications.

 If you have a question about the course or its content, you can email me or post your question on our discord
 group. You can expect to receive a response within two business days (i.e. not over the weekend)

If you need to contact me directly, my preferred method of communication is
the discord group. However, for private matters, feel free to contact me via email.  
If emailing then:
- Always include a descriptive, specific but concise subject. 
- Include your course number your email, and provide adequate context for your question in order to ensure full understanding of your email. 
- Be sure to use your NC State email account, and sign in with your name and Student ID number.

## Description

AI for SE is different to standard AI. The data sets are different
(far more repetitive structures, far more unlabelled data, far more
variance in the labels). The problems explored are different (e.g.
software configuration, software project estimation). The goals are
different (more managerial level, more uncertainty management, more
emphasis on explainability and repeatability).  The methods are
different (more emphasis on the scripting and continuous development
and operations). The results are different (many domains are
controllable via surprisingly small theories). Hence the experimental
and statistical methods are different.

Topics:

- Differences between “AI” and “AI for SE”. 
- Explainable AI. 
- AI for software configuration. 
-  Classification, clustering, explanation.,  
- Multi-objective optimization (for non-continuous models). 
- Semi-supervised learning.
- Theorem proving
- Software analytics: current methods, statistical methods, latest results.
- Management of AI software projects.
- AI,SE and ethics.

Course Objectives:

- To enable students to develop as successful professionals for highly competitive positions, applying “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”  in academic departments, industry, and government.
- To prepare students to be effective researchers in the field of  “AI for SE” and “SE for AI”

Learning Outcomes

- Students will achieve a high level of expertise in  “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” , mastery of the knowledge in that fields and the ability to apply this knowledge and graduate school experiences to critical research problems
- Students will become independent researchers in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”, developing a substantial expertise in that area that allows them to make an original contribution to it
- Students will state a research problem in such a way that it clearly fits within the context of the literature in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” and demonstrate the value of the solution to the research problem in advancing knowledge within that area
- Students will apply sound research methods/tools to problems in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” and describe the methods/tools effectively
- Students will analyze/interpret research data
- Students will communicate their research clearly and professionally in both written and oral forms appropriate to “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”






## Assessment


Grades come from 
- 10 homeworks
- 1 mid-session exam 
- 5 pop quizzes, simple questions, 2 marks each (called at any time)
- 1 eight page report on a large project (due end of semester)

Exams are done individually. Everything else is done in  groups of 3 (groups of 1 for 700 level students)

- Homeworks are small tasks 
  - submitted each week (a URL, to Mooddle)
  - graded -1 (for no submission), 1 (for "please try again") and 2 for "good".
  - may be remarked if resubmitted within two weeks or original dues date 
  
- Projects comprise a  large tasks  (working in public Github repos-- not NCSU GH):

## Expectations for learner participation and interaction


Course activities will require you to interact with other students in the course. 
For masters students, some evidence must be generated that you are actively engaged with your class peers. Specifically:

- The project repo MUST have a branch called "MAIN". Groups will be assessed via their commit history (seen under "Insights") in MAIN.
    Projects were all group members are not active doing commits will lose marks
    (or the offending student will be expelled from that group).
- Groups need to maintain an active discussion in the channel within the subject's Discord channel. 
    Projects were all group members are not active in discussions  will either lose marks 
    (or the offending student will be expelled from that group).


### Grades


|group | group/solo | mark| notes                                                      | 
|------|--------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|homeworks (ten)|group       | 10 \* 2    |      | 
|mid-term       |solo        | 30        | mid-term                                | 
| quiz          |solo        | 5 \* 2        |                                   |
|project        |group        | 40        | project report                          |

With the final grades, the following grade scale will be used: 

     A+ (97-100),  A (93-97),   A-(90-92)
     B+ (87-89),   B (83-87),   B-(80-82)
     C+ (77-79),   C (73-77),   C-(70-72)
     D+ (67-69),   D (63-67),   D-(60-62)
     F (below 60).

### Late Marks

Groups must post homeworks each  week, even if it is incomplete, OR THEY WILL LOSE ONE MARK.  Those lost marks are never returned.
Otherwise, students are marked 1 or 2 for "try again" and "ok". If you get a "1" mark and resubmit, that can be replaced with a "2".

For big project , students will lose 1 mark per day for late submissions (weekend = 1 day).



### Attendance

Lectures are twice a week. Attendance is not mandatory. Lectures will be recorded.

However, there are spot quizzes for which you will earn zero marks if you are not present at the time
of the quiz.
If, for a quiz, you miss for reasons of sudden  illness, then go to lecturer's office hours and plead your case.
If, for a quiz, you must be absence for a reason sanction by the university, contact the lecturer before time and other arrangements will be made.
Those sanctioned times are:

- Representing an official university function (e.g. athletics)
- Required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court.
- Students will be allowed a minimum of two excused absences per academic year for religious observances 
- Required military duty as certified by the student's commanding officer.
- Unanticipated absences. Examples include:
  - Short-term illness or injury
  - Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately. 

Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to
attend  mandatory office hours session.
There, students may be asked to review code,
concepts, or comment on the structure of the
course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to
attend will result in marks being deducted.

### Expected Workload
This is an _advanced graduate_ class at  R1 institution 
(an R1 institution is classified as a doctoral university with very high research activity). 


 Students must be
prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class (excluding the time spent in the
lecture meeting). Laboratory instruction is not included
in this subject.

Any remark you make
in some on-line comment tracking system like Github
is a public document.
So take heed of the following cautionary tale.
One year, a student was joking around with
his buddy in a Github issue report. Then he was
rude enough and stupid enough to 
add a remark about how the rest of the
team was just so
&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;
&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;.
Needless to say,
the rest of the team took great
offense at this remark and invoked the University's
non-discrimination policies. As a result, everyone
lost much time that semester, as well as grades. 




### Syllabus Modification Statement

Our syllabus represents a flexible agreement. It outlines the topics we will cover and the order in which we will cover them. Dates for assignments represent the earliest possible time they would be due. The pace of the class depends on student mastery and interests. Thus minor changes in the syllabus can occur if we need to slow down or speed up the pace of instruction.
