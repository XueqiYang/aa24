Course Credit Hours: 3

## Description

AI for SE is different to standard AI. The data sets are different
(far more repetitive structures, far more unlabelled data, far more
variance in the labels). The problems explored are different (e.g.
software configuration, software project estimation). The goals are
different (more managerial level, more uncertainty management, more
emphasis on explaiability and repeatability).  The methods are
different (more emphasis on the scripting and continuous development
and operations). The results are different (many domains are
controllable via surprisingly small theories). Hence the experimental
and statistical methods are different.

Topics:

- Differences between “AI” and “AI for SE”. Explainable AI. 
- AI for software configuration. 
-  Classification, clustering, explanation.,  
- Multi-objective optimization (for non-continuous models). 
- Semi-supervised learning.
- Theorem proving
- Software analytics: current methods, statistical methods, latest results.
- Management of AI software projects.
- AI,SE and ethics.

Course Objectives:

- To enable students to develop as successful professionals for highly competitive positions, applying “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”  in academic departments, industry, and government.
- To prepare students to be effective researchers in the field of  “AI for SE” and “SE for AI”

Outcomes

- Students will achieve a high level of expertise in  “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” , mastery of the knowledge in that fields and the ability to apply this knowledge and graduate school experiences to critical research problems
- Students will become independent researchers in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”, developing a substantial expertise in that area that allows them to make an original contribution to it
- Students will state a research problem in such a way that it clearly fits within the context of the literature in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” and demonstrate the value of the solution to the research problem in advancing knowledge within that area
- Students will apply sound research methods/tools to problems in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” and describe the methods/tools effectively
- Students will analyze/interpret research data
- Students will communicate their research clearly and professionally in both written and oral forms appropriate to “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”

## Assessment


Grades come from 
- 10 homeworks
- 1 mid-session exam 
- 5 spot quizzes (called at any time)
- 1 eight page report on a large project (due end of semester) 

Exams are done individually. Everything else is done in  groups of 3 (groups of 1 for 700 level students)


- Homeworks are small tasks 
  - graded -1 (for no submission), 1 (for "please try again") and 2 for "good".
  - may be remarked if resubmitted within two weeks or original dues date 
  
- Projects comprise a  large tasks  (working in public Github repos-- not NCSU GH):
  - The project repo MUST have a branch called "MAIN". Groups will be assessed via their commit history (seen under "Insights") in MAIN. Projects were
    all group members are not active doing commits will lose marks.


### Grades


|group |mark   | notes                                                      | 
|------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|homework      | 10 \* 2    |      | 
|mid-term (solo)          | 30        | mid-term                                |

|project       | 40        | project report                          |


 
With the final grades, the following grade scale will be used: 


     A+ (97-100),  A (93-96),   A-(90-92)
     B+ (87-89),   B (83-86),   B-(80-82)
     C+ (77-79),   C (73-76),   C-(70-72)
     D+ (67-69),   D (63-66),   D-(60-62)
     F (below 60).


### Late Marks

Groups must post homeworks each  week, even if it is incomplete, OR THEY WILL LOSE ONE MARK.  Those lost marks are never returned.
Otherwse, students are makred 1 or 2 for "try again" and "ok". If you get a "1" mark and resubmit, that can be replaced with a "2".


For big project , students will lose 1 mark per day for late submissions (weekend = 1 day).

+ Students must create a channel here for their group discussions. Projects without a vibrant group discussion (recorded here) will lose mark.s

## Other Information


### Attendance

Lectures are twice a week. Attendance is not mandatory. Lectures will be recorded.

However, there are spot quizzes for which you will earn zero marks if you are not present at the time
of the quiz.
If, for a quiz, you miss for reasons of sudden  illness, then go to lecturer's office hours and plead your case.
If, for a quiz, you must be absence for a reason sanction by the university, contact the lecturer before time and other arrangements will be made.
Those sanctioned times are:

- Representing an official university function (e.g. athletics)
- Required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court.
- Students will be allowed a minimum of two excused absences per academic year for religious observances 
- Required military duty as certified by the student's commanding officer.
- Unanticipated absences. Examples include:
  - Short-term illness or injury
  - Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately. 

Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to
attend  mandatory office hours session.
There, students may be asked to review code,
concepts, or comment on the structure of the
course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to
attend will result in marks being deducted.

### Expected Workload
This is an _advanced graduate_ class at  R1 institution 
(an R1 institution is classified as a doctoral university with very high research activity). 


 Students must be
prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class (excluding the time spent in the
lecture meeting). Laboratory instruction is not included
in this subject.



### Academic Integrity


Cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted. Cheating
includes plagiarism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:


+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.


Students are encouraged to read each others code and report **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:


+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.


All students are expected to maintain traditional
standards of academic integrity by giving proper
credit for all work.  All suspected cases of
academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued.
You should be aware of the University policy on
academic integrity found in the Code of Student
Conduct.
 
The  exams will be done individually.  Academic integrity is important.  Do not work together on the exams: cheating on either will be punished to the full extent permitted.


### Disabilities


Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with the Disability Resource Office at Holmes Hall, Suite 304, Campus Box 7509, 919-515-7653. For more information on NC State’s policy on working with students with disabilities, please see the Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Regulation (REG02.20.01) (https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-01/).


Students are responsible for reviewing the PRRs
which pertain to their course rights and
responsibilities. These include:
[http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05)
(Equal
Opportunity and Non-Discrimination Policy
Statement),
[https://oied.ncsu.edu/home/](https://oied.ncsu.edu/home/)
(Office for Institutional Equity and
Diversity),
[http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01)
(Code of Student Conduct), and
[http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03](http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03)
(Grades and Grade Point Average).


### Policy on Incomplete Grades


If an extended deadline is not authorized by the Graduate School,
an unfinished incomplete grade will automatically change to an F
after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which the
student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) by the
end of 12 months if the student is not enrolled, whichever is
shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted
course on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade
is the responsibility of the student. The university policy on
incomplete grades is located at
http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03. Additional
information relative to incomplete grades for graduate students can
be found in the Graduate Administrative Handbook in Section 3.18.F
at http://www.ncsu.edu/grad/handbook/index.php


### Digital Course Components


Instructors are not responsible for ensuring privacy
or accessibility of electronic materials that are not required
components of the course (e.g., links to supplemental information
that is not part of the required reading list). However, instructors
should judiciously consider the privacy, copyright, and accessibility
of supplemental links provided to students and warn them of any
known issues or concerns in this regard. See Online Course Material
Host Requirements (NCSU REG 08.00.11).


### Non-Discrimination Policy
 <img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4276/34435689480_2e6f358510_k_d.jpg" align=right width=500>


NC State provides equal opportunity and affirmative action efforts,
and prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination, harassment, and
retaliation ("Prohibited Conduct") that are based upon a person's
race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin,
age (40 or older), disability, gender identity, genetic information,
sexual orientation, or veteran status (individually and collectively,
"Protected Status"). Additional information as to each Protected
Status is included in NCSU REG 04.25.02 (Discrimination, Harassment
and Retaliation Complaint Procedure). NC State's policies and
regulations covering discrimination, harassment, and retaliation
may be accessed at http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05 or
https://oied.ncsu.edu/divweb/. Any person who feels that he or she
has been the subject of prohibited discrimination, harassment, or
retaliation should contact the Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO)
at 919-515-3148.


+ Note that, as a lecturer, I am legally required to
**report** all such acts to the campus policy<sup>1</sup>.


<sup>1</sup>Note that any remark you make
in some on-line comment tracking system like Github
is a public document.
So take heed of the following cautionary tale.
One year, a student was joking around with
his buddy in a Github issue report. Then he was
rude enough and stupid enough to 
add a remark about how the rest of the
team was just so
&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;
&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;&#9632;.
Needless to say,
the rest of the team took great
offense at this remark and invoked the University's
non-discrimination policies. As a result, everyone
lost much time that semester, as well as grades. 


Retaliation
against any person who complains about
discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's
policies and regulations covering discrimination,
harassment, and retaliation may be accessed at
[http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05) or
[http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/](http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/).
Any person who feels
that he or she has been the subject of prohibited
discrimination, harassment, or retaliation should
contact the Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) at
919-515-3148.


### Liability Insurance.


(Included for completeness... but this is not text that is really relevant to this semester.)


Non-scheduled class time for field trips or
out-of-class activities are NOT required for this
class. No such trips are currently planned.


However,
if they do happen then students are required to
purchase liability insurance. For more information,
see [http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/insurance/](http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/insurance/).
