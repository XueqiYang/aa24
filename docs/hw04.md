## Sequential model optimization

from https://github.com/timm/lo/blob/6jan24/src/gate.lua#L194-L233

20 times, run gate() and catch the ouputs from `print("1...` to` `print("5...)`.
- note that each run needs to fully reset the DATA (so nothing carries over from one row to the next)
- ensure your random 

Sort that output so all the "1" rows are together, all the "2" rows are together, etc.

Answer this question, with justifications from this output:

- does SMO do better than the random baselines  (see prints 1,2,4)?
- how many y row evaluations are required for print 3?
- how does SMO do compared to absolute best (print 3)


```
BUDGET0 = 4   # how may items to initially evaluate
BUDGET = 10   # how may items to subsequently evaluate
SOME = 0.5    # within (say) 9 evaluated examples, BEST is the top n^SOME; 
              # e.g. SOME = 0.5, BEST = 3 examples

function gate()
  load data
  shuffle order of rows                  
  print("1. top6", y values of first 6 examples in ROWS)    #baseline1
  print("2. top50", y values of first 50 examples in ROWS) #baseline2

  sort ROWS on "distance to heaven" (see below)
  print("3. most", y values of ROW[1])

  ROWS = shuffle(ROWS)                   # again good experimental practice
  LITE = grab the first BUDGET0 items    #  things we now "y" values
  DARK = rows - LITE                     # things we don't know "y" values
  
  for i = 1,BUDGET  do
    sort LITE on "distance to heaven" (see below)
    n=len(LITE)^SOME
    BEST,REST = lite[:n], lite[n:]
    TODO,SELECTED = split(BEST,REST,LITE,DARK)
    print("4: rand", y values of centroid of (from DARK, select BUDGET0+i rows at random))
    print("5: mid", y values of centroid of SELECTED)
    print("6: top:, y values of first row in BEST)
    move item TODO from DARK to LITE
 
```
Support code:
```
# distance to heaven scores lower for rows whose goals are closer to the ideal 
function "distance2heaven"
  given a row with value V for N goals
  given knowledge of MAX,MIN values seen for those goals
  given knowledge of HEAVEN for each goal (0 for minimize, 1 for maximize)
  norm = function(c,x) return (x-LO[c])/(HI[c]-LO[c])
  return (sum( (heaven - norm(y, 
                             row.cells[y.at]))^2
                for _y, in pairs(data.cols.y)) / #goals)^.5 

function split(BEST,REST,LITE,DARK)
  selected = []
  score each   row in  dark
    b = likelihod that row belongs to best
    r = likelihod that row belongs to rest
    if b > r then selected += [row] end
    score = (b+r)/abs(b-r)
  TODO= index of row with max score
  return TODO, SELECTED
```
