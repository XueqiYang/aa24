# Homeworks

Recode my Lua code in Python. 
- Understand my code
- Use ChatGPT, if you are brave.
- But you need to understange EVERY LINE of my code
  - Exams will show you buggy version of my Lua and you will  be asked the following question:
    -  Locate and list the bugs;
    -  Described in Eglish the effects of those bugs
    -  Describe in English  how to change the code  

Using minimal imports 
- no: noscikitlearn,   pandas,   argparse,   optparse,   fire,   click
- yes: re, ast, etc

## Resubmission

Homeworks can be submitted once, then resubmitted twice more. But homeworks due week in week "i" will not be remarked after week "i+2".  

## Grading

Graded weekly
- 2 = good enough
- 1 = do more
- -1 = not enough

If no submission each week, then -1.  If not enough submitted each week then -1.

## Branches
Work any braching system you like but  students will lose marks if we do not see, from each student,   regular submissions to a branch named "main".

## Tasks

For weeks 2,3,4 work from [gate.lua](https://github.com/timm/lo/blob/6jan24/src/gate.lua). After that, move to [mylo.lua](https://github.com/timm/lo/blob/6jan24/src/mylo.lua).
