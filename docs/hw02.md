### Week2

Code up just a  little bit of a sequential model optimizer 
(for  this week, just the data inut routines)


- Read code you will be implementing [^gatecode]
- Read the appendix of [^gatedoc] (a tour of Lua)
- Read pages 4 to 15 of [^gatedoc]
- Grab a sample data file https://github.com/timm/lo/blob/main/data/auto93.csv

Get some of [^gatecode] working: just to the point where you can read in
a CSV file and print some stats. You will need to get working NUM, SYM, COLS, DATA,ROW

Ignore anything not assocaited with data inout or stats generation.

Your output should look somthing like this:

```
python3 gate.py -f ../data/auto93.csv -t stats > w2.out
cat w2.out
{.N: 398, Acc+: 15.57, Lbs-: 2970.42, Mpg+: 23.84}
``` 
Don't use scikitlearn or Pandas or Pytest


Divide the data up so that a group of people can work it

- One seperate file for each class
- One seperate file for the config settings (see top of [^gatecode]

- Make the code self-documenting:
  - a "-h" flag on the command line that prints help text. For code to
    do that, see  https://github.com/timm/lo/blob/main/src/tricks.py
- Make the code testable.
  -  Your code needs test cases (at least 3 per student per week)
  -  Add pre-commit hook for tests pass/fail
  -  Build a test engine where
     -   From command line can run one or all or tests (and if running all, return number of failing tests to oeprating system)
     -   Ensure your setup resets the random numbers seed and caches the config
     -   Ensure your teardown resets to config to the cached values
     -   e.g. see the `run()` function in [^gatecode].

## What to submit

A url to your repo with a directory "hw/w2" containing `w2.out`;
and a `src` directory containing `gate.py`.
