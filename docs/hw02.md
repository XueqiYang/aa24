### Week2

Code up just a  little bit of a sequential model optimizer 
(for  this week, just the data inut routines)

- Read code you will be implementing [^gatecode]
- Read the appendix of [^gatedoc] (a tour of Lua)
- Read pages 4 to 15 of [^gatedoc]
- Grab a sample data file https://github.com/timm/lo/blob/main/data/auto93.csv

Get some of [^gatecode] working: just to the point where you can read in
a CSV file and print some stats. You will need to get working NUM, SYM, COLS, DATA,ROW

Your output should look somthing like this (this reports the means and modes
of each column of data):

```
python3 gate.py -f ../data/auto93.csv -t stats > w2.out
cat w2.out
{.N: 398, Acc+: 15.57, Lbs-: 2970.42, Mpg+: 23.84}
``` 

| notes | what |
|-------|------|
|Don't do much| Ignore anything not assocaited with data inout or stats generation. So ignore: <br>- `like,likes,d2h,small, gate,split, bestRest`<br>- anything starting with `l.`<br>- anything any  `eg.` _NOT_ assocaited with stats|
|Roll your own |Don't use scikitlearn or Pandas or Pytest|
|Avoid  "?" | In the test data I've given you, there are some "?" denoting missing values|
|Lots of filles| Divide the data up so that a group of people can work it<br>- 1 file per class<br> - 1 file for config<br>- Tests in seperate file|
|Self-docmenting|  Make the code self-documenting. Add a "-h" flag on the command line that prints help text. For code to do that in Pythong, see  https://github.com/timm/lo/blob/main/src/tricks.py |
|Testable| Your code needs test cases (at least 3 per student per week).<br>Add pre-commit hook for tests pass/fail.<br>At  command line, add -t<br>- `-t X` runs test X<br>- `-t all` runs all tests, sets `$?` to  #fails<br>- Test setup resets  seed, caches the config<br>- Test teardown resets config|
|Random control| Add a `-s` flag so you can set the random number seed|

## What to submit

A url to your repo with a directory "hw/w2" containing `w2.out`;
and a `src` directory containing `gate.py`.
