- waterfall: plan-based
  - a linear walk through analysis, design, code, test with 
    feedback from `step[i]` updating `step[i+1]`. 
- agile: maintain a backlog of stuff not yet done
  - loop
    - sort backlog by value/time
    - sprint to finish the top N items
    - repeat
- agilefall : working at a continuum between plan-driven (a.k.a. waterfall) 
  project management and agile project management
  - usually a pejorative term.
    - we pretend to be agile but actually, we never adapt to change.
  - taken seriously by some [^Bakg]
- spiral model: iterate to explore and (hopefully) retire risk, before committing to a fixed plan
